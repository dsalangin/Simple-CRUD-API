# Simple CRUD API

CRUD API Assignment
Description
This project implements a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using an in-memory database. The API allows managing user records with basic user information.

Technical Requirements
Implemented in JavaScript or TypeScript

Only allowed dependencies:

nodemon, dotenv, cross-env

TypeScript related: typescript, ts-node, ts-node-dev

Linting/formatting: eslint, prettier

Webpack: webpack-cli, webpack and plugins/loaders

uuid for ID generation

@types/* for type definitions

Testing libraries

Node.js version 22.14.0 or higher

Asynchronous API preferred

API Endpoints
Users Resource (/api/users)
GET /api/users
Returns all users

Status code: 200

Response: Array of user objects

GET /api/users/{userId}
Returns a specific user by ID

Success: 200 with user object

Invalid UUID: 400 with error message

Not found: 404 with error message

POST /api/users
Creates a new user

Success: 201 with created user object

Missing required fields: 400 with error message

PUT /api/users/{userId}
Updates an existing user

Success: 200 with updated user object

Invalid UUID: 400 with error message

Not found: 404 with error message

DELETE /api/users/{userId}
Deletes a user

Success: 204 (no content)

Invalid UUID: 400 with error message

Not found: 404 with error message

User Object Structure
typescript
{
  id: string; // UUID generated by server
  username: string; // required
  age: number; // required
  hobbies: string[]; // required (can be empty array)
}
Error Handling
Non-existing endpoints: 404 with human-friendly message

Server errors: 500 with human-friendly message

Environment Configuration
Port number is configured in .env file

Running the Application
Development Mode
bash
npm run start:dev
Runs the application using nodemon or ts-node-dev for hot-reloading.

Production Mode
bash
npm run start:prod
Builds the application and runs the bundled file.

Cluster Mode (Horizontal Scaling)
bash
npm run start:multi
Starts multiple instances of the application using Node.js Cluster API:

Creates instances equal to available parallelism - 1

Each instance listens on PORT + n (e.g., 4001, 4002, etc.)

Includes a load balancer on the main port (4000) using Round-robin algorithm

Maintains consistent database state across all workers

Testing
The project includes at least 3 test scenarios covering:

Basic CRUD operations

Error cases (invalid UUIDs, missing fields)

Edge cases

Example test scenario:

GET all users (empty array)

POST create new user

GET created user by ID

PUT update the user

DELETE the user

Verify user is deleted

Implementation Notes
In-memory database maintains state during application runtime

All operations are asynchronous

Input validation is performed for all requests

Consistent error responses with appropriate status codes
